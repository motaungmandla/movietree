This is a website I built while learning web development with javascript. I like that I can bring entertainment to people in the form of movies and shows.
This website uses an API key to fetch movies from a remote database. It entirely uses MERN stack approach to web development. This website is still under development but it is hosted on the vercel servers and may be visited here : https://movietree.vercel.app
